# Projects
My work for Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Data Science studies.

In the lists below, you will see the explanations of my work, which algorithms and models I work with.

**1.Streamlining Employee Data:** In this project, i imported employee and human resources data (an Imaginary Company) in CSV, Excel, and JSON format. Then merge it all into a single DataFrame, before cleaning it and exporting your results into a single CSV file.
The programming language used is Python and the library used is Pandas.


**2.Predicting Credit Card Approvals:** We'll use the Credit Card Approval dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The structure of this notebook is as follows:
First, we will start off by loading and viewing the dataset.
We will see that the dataset has a mixture of both numerical and non-numerical features, that it contains values from different ranges, plus that it contains a number of missing entries.
We will have to preprocess the dataset to ensure the machine learning model we choose can make good predictions.
After our data is in good shape, we will do some exploratory data analysis to build our intuitions.
Finally, we will build a machine learning model that can predict if an individual's application for a credit card will be accepted.

**3.Predict Blood Donation:** TPOT is a Python Automated Machine Learning tool that optimizes machine learning pipelines using genetic programming. Programming Language is python, best model based on TPOT is logistic regression. 

**4.Gradient Boosting Regressor:** The aim of this project is to determine the payment obligations made according to the profiles of the customers who had health insurance and the future risk profile accordingly. Programming Language used is Python and Machine Learning Model is Gradient Boosting Regressor.
