My work for Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Data Science studies.

In the lists below, you will see the explanations of my work, which algorithms and models I work with.

**1.Streamlining Employee Data:** In this project, i imported employee and human resources data (an Imaginary Company) in CSV, Excel, and JSON format. Then merge it all into a single DataFrame, before cleaning it and exporting your results into a single CSV file.
The programming language used is Python and the library used is Pandas.
